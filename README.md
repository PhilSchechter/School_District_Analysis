# School_District_Analysis
####Columbia Data Analytics, module 4

## Overview, purpose of original study

This is a school-district study of the peformance of schools within the district. The metrics of success are
- avg math scores 
- avg reading scores
- % of math scores passing (70 or over)
- % of reading scores passing
- % of passing students : students having both passing math and reading scores.
The final metric is the most critical, and how schools are ranked.

These results are shown for the district as a whole, by school and grade, and for various grouping of schools (charter/public, size bands, spending per student bands)

## Purpose of this revision

There is some suspicion of improper test results for the 9th grade in Thomas High; the school board wants to exlude these from any results presented; this revision takes these scores and regenerates the analysis.
